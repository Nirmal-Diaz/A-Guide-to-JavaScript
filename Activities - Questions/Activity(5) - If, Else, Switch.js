//PART 1
//Build a program that prints the "grade" for the following requirement using if-else if-else structure
//*. There are "score" and "grade" variables declared for you
//1. If score >= 60 then grade = "D"
//2. If score >= 70 then grade = "C"
//3. If score >= 80 then grade = "B"
//4. If score >= 90 then grade = "A"
//5. If score < 60 then grade = "F"

let score = 76;
let grade;

//PART 2
//Build a program that prints the "monthName" for a given "monthNumber" using if structure
//*. There are "monthName" and "monthNumber" variables declared for you
//1. The program must print "Invalid month number" for an invalid monthNumber (eg: 20)

let monthNumber = 5;
let monthName;

//PART 3
//Optimize the above code using if-else if structure

//PART 4
//Further optimize the above code using if-else if-else structure

//PART 5
//Further optimize the above code by converting it to the switch structure

//PART 6
//Build a program that prints days of the week starting from the "weekDayName" until "Saturday"
//*. Assume that the week starts with "Sunday" and ends with "Saturday"
//*. There is "weekDayName" variable declared for you
//1. The program must print "Invalid week day" for an invalid weekDayName (eg: Mayday)

let weekDayName = "Thursday";
